# Tile-World
A simple game I created to answer a [question on gamedev StackExchange](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/132064/2d-tile-movement-and-camera)

## Blah Blah Blah
This game has a black box moving around a world. You view the character through a viewport (aka camera) and so you can' see the whole world. Well there's not much to see really, just brown boxs :D

This game isn't commented well (CORRECTION: it is now, sort of) and it still has a few bugs (made it in a couple of hours so don't expect much), but it does it's job though.

Check the [issues](https://github.com/Kitanga/Tile-World/issues) for anything that might be wrong with this code.

## Usage

Just download/clone this repo and then open index.html. The game should run. If it doesn't then just refresh.

Use arrow key's for controls
